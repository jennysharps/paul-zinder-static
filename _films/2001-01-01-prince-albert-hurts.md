synopsis: >-
  Joe chooses the infamous “Prince Albert” genital piercing as his first foray
  into body modification. Melissa has never performed a Prince Albert on a
  client, but is game for anything. The Prince Albert usually takes
  approximately 50 seconds to complete. Joe and Melissa’s first shot becomes an
  11 minutes-plus odyssey, brimming with patience, pain, humor, hope, and
  triumph.
